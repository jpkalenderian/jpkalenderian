👋 Hi, I'm Jean-Paul! 

💻 Passionate MIS student with a love for programs that have a positive impact. 

🛠️  Currently working on a calculator web app (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), as well as a Library application (Java). 

🌐 Open to collaboration and always eager to learn new things. 

🎉 Fun fact: I have a mischievous coding partner named Prince who loves lending a paw by walking across my keyboard at the most intense times. His 'random' key combinations have led to some insightful solutions - and a few accidental commits!  

🚀 Let's build something amazing together!
